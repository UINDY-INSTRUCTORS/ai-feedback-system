## Feedback Philosophy

### Tone and Approach
- **Encouraging**: This is a learning experience. Frame feedback as opportunities for growth.
- **Specific**: Reference exact sections, figures, equations, or code lines.
- **Actionable**: Give concrete suggestions students can implement.
- **Balanced**: Always start with strengths before discussing improvements.

### What Good Work Looks Like
In this assignment, exemplary work includes:
- [Specific characteristic 1]
- [Specific characteristic 2]
- [Specific characteristic 3]

### Common Student Challenges
Students often struggle with:
- [Challenge 1 and what to look for]
- [Challenge 2 and what to look for]
- [Challenge 3 and what to look for]

## Criterion-Specific Guidance

### [Criterion 1 Name]

**What to look for**:
- [Specific thing 1]
- [Specific thing 2]

**Common mistakes**:
- [Mistake 1: description and how to identify it]
- [Mistake 2: description and how to identify it]

**Good example**:
> [Example of excellent work for this criterion]

**Feedback suggestions**:
- If [condition], suggest: "[specific actionable feedback]"
- If [condition], suggest: "[specific actionable feedback]"

---

### [Criterion 2 Name]

**What to look for**:
- [Specific thing 1]
- [Specific thing 2]

**Common mistakes**:
- [Mistake 1]
- [Mistake 2]

**Red flags** (indicates unsatisfactory):
- [Serious issue 1]
- [Serious issue 2]

**Feedback suggestions**:
- For [issue], recommend: "[specific improvement]"

## Domain-Specific Considerations

### For This Course/Assignment:

**Technical terminology**:
- Use these terms: [list of appropriate technical terms for feedback]
- Avoid jargon like: [terms students may not know yet]

**References and resources**:
Students should be citing:
- [Required reference 1: e.g., "LM324 datasheet"]
- [Required reference 2: e.g., "Textbook Chapter 5"]
- [Other acceptable references]

**Tools and software**:
Students are using:
- [Tool 1: e.g., "LTspice for circuit simulation"]
- [Tool 2: e.g., "Python with NumPy/Matplotlib"]
- [Tool 3: e.g., "Oscilloscope and function generator"]

When giving feedback about these tools, consider:
- [Expectation 1]
- [Expectation 2]

## Formatting Guidelines

### Report Structure
Expected sections:
1. [Section 1: e.g., "Introduction"]
2. [Section 2: e.g., "Methodology"]
3. [Section 3: e.g., "Results"]
4. [Section 4: e.g., "Discussion"]
5. [Section 5: e.g., "Conclusion"]

Note: Flexibility allowed - students may organize differently as long as content is complete.

### Figures and Tables
- All figures should have: [captions, labels, units, etc.]
- All tables should have: [headers, units, etc.]
- Citation style: [IEEE, APA, Chicago, etc.]

### Code (if applicable)
- Expected language: [Python, C, MATLAB, etc.]
- Style guide: [PEP8, Google Style, etc.]
- Documentation: [docstrings required? inline comments?]

## Feedback Format Template

For each criterion, use this structure:

```
### [Criterion Name] ([Weight]%)
**Assessment**: [✅ Exemplary / ⚠️ Satisfactory / ⚠️ Developing / ❌ Unsatisfactory]

**Strengths**:
- [Specific strength with reference to section/figure/line]
- [Another strength]

**Areas for Improvement**:
- [Specific, actionable suggestion with reference]
- [Another suggestion]

**Suggested Rating**: [X]/[Y] points
```

## Examples of Good vs. Bad Feedback

### ❌ Bad Feedback (vague, not actionable)
> "Your analysis needs work. Try harder next time."

### ✅ Good Feedback (specific, actionable)
> "Your analysis in Section 3.2 correctly identifies the trend, but consider adding:
> 1. Error bars to Figure 5 showing measurement uncertainty
> 2. Comparison to your theoretical prediction from Equation 4
> 3. Discussion of why the measured values are 12% higher than predicted"

## Customization Notes

**To adapt this guidance for your assignment**:
1. Fill in all [bracketed] sections
2. Add criterion-specific sections for each rubric criterion
3. Include examples of excellent work from past students (anonymized)
4. Update common mistakes based on your experience
5. Adjust tone for student level (freshman vs. senior vs. graduate)

**Assignment-specific additions**:
- Add sections for unique aspects of your assignment
- Include discipline-specific considerations
- Reference specific learning objectives from syllabus
- Note any special constraints or requirements
