## Criterion 1: Abstract & Description (10%)

Abstract concisely states the project idea, results, and uncertainty. The abstract should be no more than one or two sentences. It should explain what you measured. It could describe how you measured it, but it doesn't need to. It should include the final result,  including a measure of uncertainty.

The Description explains the idea behind the project and some sense of the motivation for doing the project in the first place. 

### Performance Levels

| Level | Points | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Excellent** | 7-10 | Abstract is clear and concise with results including uncertainty. Description clearly conveys the motivation for doing the project. |
| **Good** | 4-6 | Abstract present with basic merit. Description gives some idea of idea of the project. |
| **Poor** | 0-3 | Abstract missing or lacks substantial merit. Description missing or unclear. |

### Excellent Indicators
- Project idea stated absolutely clearly
- Results stated with uncertainty
- Motivation for doing the project well explained

### Good Indicators
- Basic idea of project is stated
- Result is stated (may lack uncertainty)
- Description present but could be clearer

### Poor Indicators
- Project idea not clearly stated
- Result missing or stated unclearly
- Description missing or doesn't convey any motivation

### Keywords
abstract, description, purpose, result, uncertainty, plan

### Common Issues
- Abstract too vague or overly detailed
- Results stated without uncertainty
- Purpose of project not explained

## Criterion 2: Circuit Schematic, Background and Discussion (20%)

Circuit details are described clearly and correctly. A competent person should be able to reproduce your results based on the provided documentation. Component values are given in addition to the process used to choose those values based on project requirements or constraints.

### Performance Levels

| Level | Points | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Excellent** | 13-20 | All important circuit details described correctly. |
| **Good** | 7-12 | Most important details described clearly. |
| **Poor** | 0-6 | Important circuit details missing or incorrect. |

### Excellent Indicators
- All important circuit details present and clear. Component values are chosen using a clear process that makes sense.

### Good Indicators
- Most important details present and correct. A process is described for choosing component values, but may be slightly flawed or non-ideal.

### Poor Indicators
- Important details missing or incorrect
- No process is described for choosing component values

### Keywords
circuit, schematic, background, diagram, component

### Common Issues
- Component values not labeled on schematic
- No explanation of how circuit works
- Schematic not readable or poorly drawn
- No explanation of how component values are chosen

## Criterion 3: Circuit Function (40%)

Circuit is constructed and functions correctly. Code is readable.
Correct operation validated through measurements.

### Performance Levels

| Level | Points | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Excellent** | 26-40 | Circuit functions flawlessly. Code and data are excellent. Function quantitatively validated. |
| **Good** | 14-25 | Circuit functions almost perfectly. Schematic/code fairly readable. Some validation attempted. |
| **Poor** | 0-13 | No evidence circuit is constructed or evidence does not indicate correct function. No demonstration of correct operation. |

### Excellent Indicators
- Evidence provided that circuit functions correctly
- Correct function validated quantitatively with measurements
- Statistical analysis used to validate operation

### Good Indicators
- Circuit all there and functions almost perfectly
- Some documentation embedded
- Some attempt at validation with measurements
- Basic statistical analysis present

### Poor Indicators
- Circuit not constructed or not functional
- No demonstration of correct operation
- Schematic/code difficult to understand
- Minimal or no documentation
- No validation measurements

### Keywords
circuit, function, operation, test, measurement, validate, code, schematic

### Common Issues
- Circuit built but not tested/validated
- Missing test measurements to prove functionality
- Statistical analysis not performed

## Criterion 4: Results (including stats exercises) (20%)

Results are complete with correct units and formulas. Valid interpretation showing
understanding. Clear graphical representations with labels. 
Statistical exercises are present and correct.

There are three stats exercises:

Exercise 1: I have three multi-sided dice. One four sided, one six sided, and one eight sided. I pick one at random and begin rolling. Suppose I get the following results: 1, 4, 2, 5. What are the probabilities that I have the four, the six, or the eight sided die? Use Bayesian update! 

Exercise 2: Using the defect distribution above, estimate the probability that you'll see a defect between $t=4.5\,{\rm min}$ and $t=5.5\,{\rm min}$ after the last defect was observed. Explain how you arrived at your answer.

Exercise 3: Use `curve_fit` to estimate the value of $\beta$ from your transistor data. Don't forget to estimate the uncertainty!

### Performance Levels

| Level | Points | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Excellent** | 13-20 | Complete results with perfect interpretation. Clear graphs with labels. All stats exercises correct. |
| **Good** | 7-12 | Mostly complete results with reasonable interpretation. Graphs fairly clear. Most stats exercises are correct. |
| **Poor** | 0-6 | Results missing or incomplete. Invalid interpretation. Graphs missing or unclear. Few stats exercises are correct. |
