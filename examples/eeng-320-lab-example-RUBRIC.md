## Criterion 1: Problem Formulation & Design Goals (10%)

Student identifies design objectives, specifications, constraints,
and success criteria. Should include quantitative targets (gain, bandwidth,
impedance, etc.)

### Performance Levels

| Level | Points | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Satisfactory** | 7-8 | Specifications present but some lack quantitative detail |
| **Unsatisfactory** | 0-4 | No clear specifications or objectives |
| **Exemplary** | 9-10 | Clear quantitative specifications with well-defined constraints |
| **Developing** | 5-6 | Vague specifications or missing key constraints |

### Keywords
objective, specification, requirement, constraint, gain, bandwidth, impedance

### Common Issues
- Vague goals like 'make it work' instead of '20dB gain, 100Hz-10kHz'
- Missing constraints (power, cost, component availability)
- No success criteria defined

---

## Criterion 2: Circuit Design & Component Selection (15%)

Student develops circuit design, creates schematic, selects components
with justification, and performs design calculations.

### Performance Levels

| Level | Points | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Satisfactory** | 10-12 | Valid design with some justification gaps |
| **Unsatisfactory** | 0-5 | No design or serious flaws |
| **Exemplary** | 13-15 | Well-justified component choices with clear schematic and calculations |
| **Developing** | 6-9 | Design present but poorly justified or incomplete |

### Keywords
schematic, component, resistor, capacitor, op-amp, calculation, justify

### Common Issues
- Components chosen without explanation (why 10kΩ vs 1kΩ?)
- No comparison of alternative topologies
- Missing or unclear schematic labels
- No design calculations shown

---

## Criterion 3: Circuit Simulations & Predictions (15%)

Student performs LTspice simulations with multiple test conditions,
parameter sweeps, and comparisons to theoretical predictions.

### Performance Levels

| Level | Points | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Satisfactory** | 10-12 | Basic simulations with limited variety or comparison |
| **Unsatisfactory** | 0-5 | No simulations or severely incomplete |
| **Exemplary** | 13-15 | Comprehensive simulations (DC, AC, transient) with theory comparison |
| **Developing** | 6-9 | Minimal simulations or missing key analyses |

### Keywords
LTspice, simulation, SPICE, AC analysis, transient, frequency response, Bode plot

### Common Issues
- Only one test condition (no parameter sweep)
- No comparison to hand calculations
- Missing DC operating point or frequency response

---

## Criterion 4: Experimental Setup & Measurements (25%)

Student builds circuit, documents setup, performs comprehensive
measurements, and collects data systematically.

### Performance Levels

| Level | Points | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Satisfactory** | 19-22 | Adequate measurements with some documentation gaps |
| **Unsatisfactory** | 0-12 | Minimal experimental work |
| **Exemplary** | 23-25 | Clear setup documentation with comprehensive measurements |
| **Developing** | 13-18 | Limited measurements or poor documentation |

### Keywords
oscilloscope, multimeter, function generator, measurement, breadboard, photo, setup

### Common Issues
- Setup not clearly documented or photographed
- Only one measurement instead of sweeping parameters
- No equipment settings documented (scope V/div, timebase, etc.)
- Missing uncertainty or error estimates

---

## Criterion 5: Data Analysis & Results Interpretation (25%)

Student analyzes data, compares theory/simulation/measurement,
performs error analysis, and draws meaningful conclusions.

### Performance Levels

| Level | Points | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Satisfactory** | 19-22 | Basic comparison with some error discussion |
| **Unsatisfactory** | 0-12 | Minimal or flawed analysis |
| **Exemplary** | 23-25 | Thorough 3-way comparison with insightful error analysis |
| **Developing** | 13-18 | Limited analysis or missing comparisons |

### Keywords
analysis, compare, error, uncertainty, measured vs simulated, frequency response

### Common Issues
- No comparison of theory vs sim vs measurement
- Discrepancies not explained
- No error bars or uncertainty discussion
- Results presented without interpretation

---

## Criterion 6: Technical Communication & Documentation (10%)

Report is well-organized with clear figures, proper citations,
and professional presentation.

### Performance Levels

| Level | Points | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Satisfactory** | 7-8 | Good organization with minor presentation issues |
| **Unsatisfactory** | 0-4 | Poor organization or unclear presentation |
| **Exemplary** | 9-10 | Excellent organization with professional figures and citations |
| **Developing** | 5-6 | Acceptable but needs improvement in clarity or organization |

### Keywords
figure, caption, label, reference, datasheet, citation, organization

### Common Issues
- Figures missing captions, labels, or units
- No references to datasheets used
- Poor organization or missing sections
